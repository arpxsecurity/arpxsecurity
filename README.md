This repository serves as a detailed and structured overview of who I am, what I work on, and how I approach technology and learning.

I am a technology enthusiast who focuses on understanding systems deeply rather than treating them as black boxes. My interests lie at the intersection of cybersecurity, web technologies, research, and technical documentation. I believe good technical work is not just built, but clearly explained, tested, and documented.

My primary areas of interest include cybersecurity fundamentals, attack surface analysis, web application behavior, automation and tooling for analysis, technical research, and fact-based documentation. I spend a lot of time breaking down complex technical concepts into clear and understandable explanations.

In my repositories, you will mostly find small to mid-scale tools built for learning and experimentation, proof-of-concept projects to understand real-world scenarios, scripts and utilities that automate analysis or repetitive tasks, and research-oriented work that prioritizes clarity over polish.

My approach is research-driven. Before building anything, I focus on understanding how a system actually works, identifying assumptions and limitations, and observing real behavior instead of relying only on theory. 
I value depth over surface-level features and clarity over unnecessary complexity.

Documentation is not an afterthought for me. Every project aims to explain why something exists, clearly define scope and limitations, and remain understandable to learners as well as practitioners.

This repository and others will evolve over time as I learn, experiment, and refine my understanding. Some projects may be incomplete, experimental, or intentionally minimal, as learning in public is part of the process.

All projects are created strictly for educational and research purposes. They are not intended for misuse, illegal activity, or harm. Responsibility for how the content is used lies entirely with the user.

I am open to learning, feedback, and constructive discussion from people interested in security, research, and clean technical documentation.
