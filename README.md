# Arpxsec-Me

This repository serves as a structured overview of who I am, what I work on, and how I approach technology and learning.

- I’m a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong foundation in cybersecurity, cloud security, and security-oriented development, backed by hands-on practice across multiple domains. 

- I’m comfortable working with penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, network and application security, Linux systems, AWS cloud environments, and security automation using Python. Alongside security, I also have practical exposure to machine learning, deep learning, data analysis, and full-stack web development, which helps me understand systems end-to-end from both attack and defense perspectives.

- Going forward, I’m actively building and refining real-world, security-focused and AI-assisted projects that reflect practical problem solving rather than just academic concepts. 

- My focus is on developing projects that demonstrate how security, cloud, AI, and software engineering intersect in real systems, while continuously improving my skills through experimentation, documentation, and ethical practice.

**Core Skills & Tools:** *PenTesting, Vulnerability Assessment, Web & Network Security, SIEM, Linux, AWS, Cloud Security, Python, Bash, C/C++, Security Automation, AI/ML (CNN, RNN, RAG), Full-Stack Development (MERN, NextJS), Git, Docker, Agile, API Testing*

Currently working on advanced security, cloud focused and AI automation projects (Products), continuously exploring and building along the way.
