# Arpxsec-Me

This repository serves as a structured overview of who I am, what I work on, and how I approach technology and learning.

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong foundation in cybersecurity, cloud security, and security-oriented development, backed by hands-on practice across multiple domains. 

I’m comfortable working with penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, network and application security, Linux systems, AWS cloud environments, and security automation using Python. Alongside security, I also have practical exposure to machine learning, deep learning, data analysis, and full-stack web development, which helps me understand systems end-to-end from both attack and defense perspectives.

Going forward, I’m actively building and refining real-world, security-focused and AI-assisted projects that reflect practical problem solving rather than just academic concepts. 

My focus is on developing projects that demonstrate how security, cloud, AI, and software engineering intersect in real systems, while continuously improving my skills through experimentation, documentation, and ethical practice.
